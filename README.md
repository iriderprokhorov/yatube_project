## Tech

Yatube uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python] - The best of language
- [Django] - Powerfull framework
- [CSS] - Adptive design for modern web apps
- [Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [HTML] - it is just html


And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
